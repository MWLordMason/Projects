            My wife Jenna and I have been married for four years, and it's been a crazy ride. Some things she likes to do is go on walks, spend time with family, and also watch our favorite shows together. We met in California where we were married and then moved to Utah and then Idaho soon after, only to then move back to Utah after a couple years in Idaho.</p>

            I have three, pets that all have their own personalities and quirks. Zeus, our Husky/Lab mix is smart when it comes to asking for things and communicating what he wants and also loves to play and run. Blacky, our black and white female cat is timid and a bit skiddish, but when shes with those she's comfortable with, she's your favorite snuggle buddy that's always nearby. And finally Leo, the grey and striped cat is our little troublemaker. He's still pretty young and is curious about everything, for his own detriment. He's also too cute to punish, so he mostly gets away with being naughty and mischevious.</p>

        <p class="descriptions">
            Some of my hobbies include Dungeons & Dragons, video games, and other tabletop games that i can all play to spend time with friends. I love music, and will often spend time talking about music and specific genres with my Dad who shares the same music taste with me. I also like spending time watching shows or consume other forms of media about world history including ancient and modern.</p>
