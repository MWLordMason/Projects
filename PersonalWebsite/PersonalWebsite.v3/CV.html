                    <p class="descriptions">During my junior and senior years in high school I was granted the oppotunity to attend an extracurricular program that specialized in subjects that had specific aims toward many different career paths. During this program I studied graphic design which included using tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Animate which I enjoyed. I then later attended an Interactive Game Design course that began my introduction into coding, 2D/3D animation, and 2D/3D modeling.</p>

                    <p class="descriptions">Dog House was my first real job. Having worked right when I legally able to during highschool, I would work full-time while also excelling in my studies in high school. I had my most significant growth period during this time in learining how to work hard, develop commuication skills, and how to work well with others. I loved the feeling of satisfaction after clocking out following a long, busy shift knowing that I did my best and worked the hardest I could to accomplish my tasks. I began to be trusted very early on with more important tasks and responsibilities after showing my commitment and dedication to my job.</p>

                    <p class="descriptions">Chick-fil-A was the next milestone in my carreer. While working here I quickly rose through the ranks until I became a shift lead. I learned the skills of leading a team, coordinating responsibilities amongst others, and supporting my team wherever possible. I learned to assess my coworkers' individual strengths and weaknesses to how to help them overcome their shortcomings.</p>

                    <p class="descriptions">Sam's Club was my introduction into the retail industry. The points of most significance that I took away from this experience was further increasing my communication skills with cutstomer satisfaction and working as a team. Using logic and great work ethic aloowed me to complete my tasks fairly quickly in order to focus more on members and their needs. I managed to occupy many different positions within the store that further increased my general work experience.</p>

                    <p class="descriptions">Thermofisher was the next pivital moment within my career of jobs. I had a major learning curve of focusing more on the production side of things rather than the actual social interactions with customers. This job definitely engrained in me the importance of deadlines for production jobs and the necessary steps on how to meet those said due dates. I was a production technician that excelled at any job given to my team. I again was able to lead teams of other technicians to meet deadlines of a variety of jobs that needed to be completed, and this further developed my skills of leadership and being a team player.</p>
